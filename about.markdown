## Welcome ## 
to the website of the CC Adapt learning course. Our objective is to make climate change adaptation accessible for municipalities. 
To the left, you can find the topics that we have implemented into the course so far. In the further process of website development, a more detailed structure will be implemented.
Until then, feel free to have a look around!
