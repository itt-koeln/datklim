## Welcome ## 
to the website of the CC Adapt learning course. Our objective is to make climate change adaptation accessible for municipalities. <br>
To the left, you can find the topics that we have implemented into the course so far. In the further process of website development, a more detailed structure will be implemented.
Until then, feel free to have a look around!
