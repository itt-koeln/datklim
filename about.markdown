## About DatKlim
Welcome to the website of the DatKlim learning course. Our objective is to make climate change adaptation accessible for municipalities. To the left, you can find the topics that we have implemented into the course so far. In the further process of website development, a more detailed structure will be implemented.
Until then, feel free to have a look around!

DatKlim is presented by the Institute for Technology and Resources in the Tropics and Subtropics (ITT) by the University of Applied Sciences Cologne (TH KÃ¶ln).
DatKlim currently consists of:
Lars Ribbe
