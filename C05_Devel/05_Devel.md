# Cluster 05 Developing Adaptation Measures


On this cluster of learning units, we will through the definition phase of setting up the objectives of the projects, and which available solutions are available to tackle this goals, this will practiced through a workshop, then once the goals, then there will be a revision of Climate Change Adaptation measures across different economic sectors and their respective interlinkages


## 11: Target Setting
What: Exercising how to set a specific objective target to the climate challenges  

How: Conducting a collaborative workshop on target setting 

Why: Allowing for a precise and targeted adaptation strategy


## 12: Climate Change Adaptation Measures 
What: Presenting and elaborating different climate change adaptation measures 

How: Reviewing selected measures, their point of impact and the interlinkages between sectors 

Why: Giving an overview over potential interventions to choose; providing benefits and disadvantages



| **Learning Unit** | **Sub-unit** | **Contents** |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| **11 – Target Setting** | Workshop: Defining clear objectives for adaptation | - Defining clear objectives for what the adaptation measure(s) need to tackle <br> - Identifying specific hazards, implications of hazards, sectors, or populations to be addressed and the reasons for targeting them <br> - Providing a clear scope and aligning it with the framework <br> - Reviewing elemental components to maintain alignment with relevant policies and regulatory frameworks |

| **12 – Climate Change Adaptation Measures** | **General Adaptation Measures** | - Defining what constitutes an adaptation measure <br> - Establishing general criteria for the effectiveness and efficiency of measures |

| | **Water Adaptation Measures** | Understanding how to possibly deal with heavy precipitation, drought & dry periods, high water & floods | - Exploring strategies for managing water resources during various hydrological conditions |

| | **Infrastructure Adaptation Measures** | Understanding how to possibly deal with infrastructure damages, restraints, and transportation shortages | - Examining measures to protect and enhance the resilience of infrastructure in the face of climate-related challenges |

| | **Land Adaptation Measures** | Understanding how to handle land degradation, agricultural adaptation, changing irrigation practices, forest management in warmer and drier climates, etc. | - Addressing measures to sustainably manage and adapt land use practices to changing climate conditions |

| | **Economic Adaptation Measures (?)** | Highlighting how to prepare for probable economic consequences within the region; insurance schemes, preparation, cost-benefit of early adaptation | - Exploring strategies such as insurance schemes, preparation, and cost-benefit analysis for early adaptation to minimize economic impacts |

| | **Spatial Planning Adaptation Measures** | Understanding how space can be used in a beneficial way to cope with future changes | - Analyzing spatial planning strategies to optimize land use and development considering climate change impacts |

| | **Intersectoral Measures** | Measures that have (positive) effects on multiple sectors | - Identifying and exploring adaptation measures that bring positive impacts across different sectors <br> - Evaluating potential conflicts and synergies between different adaptation measures and sectors <br> - (Outlook: The water-energy-food security nexus) |
