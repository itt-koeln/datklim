# Holistic Thinking
Explore the "Holistic Thinking" Cluster, where our focus lies in comprehensive understanding of the interconnections between climate adaptation, spatial planning, and stakeholder engagement. In the first learning unit, "Climate Adaptation as Part of Spatial Planning," we will provide insights into spatial planning foundations, socio-ecological systems, and practical adaptation through case studies. In the second unit, "Stakeholder Identification and Engagement," we will navigate guidelines, funding structures, and public opinion to master the art of effective stakeholder involvement.  

## 6: Climate adaptation as part of spatial planning
What: Analyzing the fundamental components of spatial planning`s contribution to climate resilience and adaptation <br>
How: Teaching the relations between sectors, examining a range of local and international examples; holding a workshop in spatial planning <br>
Why: Comprehending the interlinkages between socio-natural components and climate related challenges in order to develop smart and climate resilient regions <br>
<br>

## 7: Stakeholder identification and engagement 
What: Learning to identify relevant stakeholders within the scope of climate change adaptation and understanding their needs and objectives, as well as how to fulfill them <br>
How: Understanding the value of public opinion, learning about tools to increase stakeholder engagement and feedback <br>
Why: Decreasing conflict potential and creating an early understanding of project partners, stakeholders and how they are involved in the adaptation <br>
