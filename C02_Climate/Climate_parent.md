## Understanding climate change 
This cluster is divided into the following units and sub-units:
| Learning Unit                                      | Sub/unit                                                           | Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Objectives of the Unit                                                                                                                                |

|                                                         | 2) Climate Change Drivers                                        | - Explore different climate change drivers, such as GHG and their main gas components, feedback-loops mechanisms - Example: Climate Change Impacts by Sectors in a case study area in Germany (forestry, agriculture, water, energy resources, etc.) - Workshop: Copernicus and Climate Adaptation - Review challenges and opportunities for climate adaptation using Copernicus products |                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
