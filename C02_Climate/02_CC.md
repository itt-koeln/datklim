## Understanding climate change 
In order to plan meaningful adaptation measures, it is essential to get an understandsting of climate change and how it does affect the respective municipalities both in the present and the future. This cluster is therefore divided into 3 parts:

# 3: Introduction to Climate Change
<b>What?</b>Learning about the fundamental aspects of climate change, examining its drivers and (local) impacts; Understanding the different sectors that are affected
<b>How?</b> Getting to know the physical science behind climate change; highlighting a case study in Germany to elaborate on its effects
<b>Why?</b> Getting to know the affected sectors in order to plan well fitted adaptation measures

# 4: Climate Governance (in Germany)
<b>What?</b> Learning about international, national and regional climate policy, legal frameworks and finances, as well as their implications on the local level
<b>How?</b> Analyzing international agreements and the effect on local and regional governance
<b>Why?</b> Understanding the role of regional governance in the bigger picture, informing for effective policy making and strategic planning

# 5: Developing strategies for climate change adaptation 
<b>What?</b> Studying essential framework components for adaptation strategy development at different spatial scales
<b>How?</b> Reviewing existing frameworks on different scales of adaptation strategy, for example within the EU, in Germany, on regional or municipal level
<b>Why?</b> Framework of adaptation strategy development is elemental for appliance of any further strategy according to the AoI defined.

An overview over the contents can be found in the following table:
