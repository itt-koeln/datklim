## Introduction to climate Change
<br>
Climate change is one of the most discussed topics of our time. It is also one of the biggest challenges that we are currently facing. <br>
The <b>I</b>ntergovernmental <b>P</b>anel on <b>C</b>limate <b>C</b>hange (IPCC), perhaps the most prominent institution when it comes to communicating both the science and the practical implications of climate change, has released some statements:

<br>
In the following learning unit, we will try to decipher the meaning within those statements. How is climate change affecting every region? What does the 1.5Â°C objective really mean? How do we even know anything is changing and that humans are responsbile for that?
 <br>
Understanding the basic principles of climate change will build the foundation for the further units of the course, which will then of course focus on the question: What are we going to do about it and how?

<br>

The following table contains an overview over the outline of the unit and which topics will be included.
