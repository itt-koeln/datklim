| **1: Basic Knowledge on Data Competence**        | 1) Introduction to Data Literacy; Climate adaptation and data      | - Why is data relevant for climate change adaptation and the understanding of risk and uncertainty - Understand, interpret, and communicate effectively using data. - How to identify and get valuable data for decision and making understand various data types. | - Provide general insights into the use, quality, and sources of data - Show the relevance of data for climate change; provide relevant databases and tools - Enable learners to understand the common use of data and assess the reliability, availability, and accessibility of various data sources |
|                                                  | 2) Relevant software, tools and appliances of data science for climate change | - Overview of most common methods and tools for data organization, processing, and visualization - Applications of geodata and remote sensing - Examples of machine learning or AI in climate change sciences - Visualization and interpretation of (geo)data; geostorytelling/dashboards - Deal with geospatial and time-series data, understand their unique characteristics and challenges, and equip learners with basic knowledge and skills to effectively analyze, visualize, and interpret data evolving across geographical locations and time intervals - Understand data generation, including where and how data is recorded, monitoring benefits, and potential errors |
|                                                  | 3) Dealing with geospatial and time-series data                      |                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                      |
|                                                  | 4) Data generation                                                  |                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                     |
| **2: Data and Governance Foundational Elements** | 1) Foundational Elements of Data Governance                         | - Institutional mapping â€“ vertical and horizontal structures of data: Who are the developers/creators and users? - Appliance to Germany: Example (Geo) data infrastructures (GDI-NRW, GDI-DE, Inspire, GeoBasis NRW, etc.) - Integrating data - Ethics of data: data availability, data quality, and ownership | - Understand different levels of climate data hierarchically and geographically - Evaluate the quality and availability of data - Get to know different data sources and originator structures in Germany - Equip learners with the ability to find data at the right level and assess its quality |
